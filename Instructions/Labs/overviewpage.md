# Get started with Microsoft Fabric with Its Lakehouses

## Overall Estimated Duration: 4 Hours

## Overview
This lab provides hands-on exercises in using Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse and Data Warehouse. Participants will set up a Microsoft Fabric workspace, configure a Lakehouse, ingest data, convert files into tables, and perform data analysis using SQL queries and Power Query. You will also create a Data Warehouse, define a data model, query tables, and create views. These exercises will enhance your skills in data management, analysis, and reporting using Power BI for visualization.

## Objective

This lab is designed to give learners hands-on experience with data management and analysis using Microsoft Fabric. Learners will enhance their proficiency in data integration, transformation, storage, and analysis by utilizing the advanced tools and features offered by Microsoft Fabric.

Participants will learn:

1. **Creating and Ingesting Data with a Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse**: This hands-on exercise guides through setting up a Microsoft Fabric workspace and configuring a Lakehouse for scalable storage. You will ingest data from various sources, convert files into structured tables, and apply SQL queries for data manipulation and analysis. Participants will also use Power Query for advanced data transformations and create insightful reports with Power BI to effectively visualize and share their findings.

2. **Analyze data in a Data Warehouse**: This hands-on exercise involves creating a workspace and setting up a Data Warehouse. You will create tables and insert data, then define a data model for structured analysis. You will learn to query the Data Warehouse tables and create views for efficient data retrieval and reporting. Participants will enhance their skills in managing and analyzing data within a Data Warehouse environment.

## Prerequisites 

Participants should have:

- Basic Understanding of Data Warehousing and Data Lakes: Familiarity with the concepts of structured and unstructured data storage.
- SQL Knowledge: Ability to write and understand basic SQL queries.
- Data Analysis: Basic experience with data analysis and reporting.


## Architecture

This lab introduces the Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse, a unified data platform that combines the flexibility and scalability of a data lake with the structured querying capabilities of a data warehouse. Key components include OneLake, a scalable storage layer built on Azure Data Lake Store Gen2, and Apache Spark, which provides high-performance in-memory computation for big data processing. SQL compute engines enable complex queries on large datasets, while Delta Lake ensures ACID transactions and efficient metadata handling. Additionally, Power BI and Power Query are integrated for advanced data visualization, reporting, and manipulation.

## Explanation of Components

- **Microsoft Fabric Workspace:** A centralized environment within Microsoft Fabric where users can manage their data projects. This workspace provides access to various tools and services needed to create and analyze data in a unified platform.

- **Lakehouse:** A scalable and flexible data store within Microsoft Fabric that combines the features of a data lake and a data warehouse. It allows for the storage and querying of both structured and unstructured data using SQL and Apache Spark compute engines.

- **OneLake Storage Layer:** The underlying scalable storage layer used by the Lakehouse, built on Azure Data Lake Store Gen2. It provides robust, scalable storage for large volumes of data in various formats.

- **Data Files and Tables:** Ingested data files that are uploaded into the Lakehouse. These files can be transformed into structured tables that allow for efficient querying and analysis. Tables in Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse are based on the open-source Delta Lake file format.

- **SQL Endpoint:** A feature within Microsoft Fabric that enables users to perform SQL queries on the Lakehouse tables. It provides a familiar SQL interface for data analysts and engineers to query and analyze data efficiently.

- **Power Query:** A data connection technology that enables users to discover, connect, combine, and refine data across a wide variety of sources. In the context of Microsoft Fabric, Power Query allows for visual query creation and data transformation.

- **Power BI:** A suite of business analytics tools within Microsoft Fabric that enables users to create interactive reports and dashboards. Power BI is integrated with the Lakehouse to provide a seamless reporting and visualization experience based on the ingested data.

- **Data Transformation:** The process of converting raw data into a structured format that can be used for analysis. This includes operations such as grouping, filtering, and summarizing data to prepare it for querying and reporting.

- **Report Building:** The creation of interactive reports using Power BI, based on the data stored in the Lakehouse. This involves designing report layouts, selecting visualizations, and configuring report elements to effectively display data insights.

**Fabric trial provides access to most features, but excludes Copilot, private links, and trusted workspace access ([learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/fundamentals/fabric-trial#overview-of-the-trial-capacity)).**
