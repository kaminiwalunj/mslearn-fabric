# Work with Data Lake and Data Factory Pipelines in Microsoft Fabric​

### Overall Estimated Duration: 4 hours

## Overview

Microsoft Fabric lakehouses use Delta Lake, an open-source storage layer that enhances Spark-based data processing with relational database features. Tables in the lakehouse are Delta tables, marked by the triangular Delta (▴) icon, enabling advanced analytics. Data pipelines in Fabric automate the process of extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) data from various sources into destinations like lakehouses or data warehouses. These pipelines can be easily designed using the graphical canvas in the Fabric user interface, allowing for complex workflows with minimal coding.

## Objective

The objective is to efficiently manage and analyze data by leveraging Data Lake for scalable storage and Data Factory Pipelines in Microsoft Fabric to automate ETL workflows and streamline data processing.

- **Use Delta tables in Apache Spark:** Leverage Delta tables in Apache Spark to enable reliable, scalable, and performant data processing with ACID transactions and versioning for advanced analytics.
- **Ingest data with a pipeline:** Automate data ingestion by building pipelines to efficiently extract, transform, and load (ETL) data from various sources into a data lake or warehouse in Microsoft Fabric.


## Prerequisites

Participants should have:

- **Basic Data Engineering Knowledge:** Understanding of data storage, processing, and ETL concepts, including data lakes and warehouses.
- **Experience with Microsoft Fabric:** Familiarity with the Microsoft Fabric platform, including lakehouses, tables, and pipelines.
- **SQL Proficiency:** Strong skills in SQL for querying and managing Delta tables.
- **Understanding of Apache Spark:** Basic knowledge of Spark architecture, DataFrames, and SparkSQL for distributed data processing.
- **Familiarity with Data Pipelines:** Understanding of ETL processes and experience in building and managing data pipelines.

## Architechture

The architecture of a Microsoft Fabric lab integrates Data Lake storage with Delta tables for reliable data storage, while Data Factory Pipelines automate ETL processes. Apache Spark powers distributed data processing on Delta tables, and notebooks enable interactive analytics. The environment supports data consistency, scalability, and integration with cloud services, ensuring secure and efficient data management and processing.

## Explanation of Components

The architecture for this lab involves the following key components:

- **Workspaces:** Collaborative environments in Microsoft Fabric where users can organize and manage data, notebooks, and pipelines for seamless data analysis and processing.
- **Delta Lake:** A storage layer that enables ACID transactions, versioning, and scalable data management on top of Data Lake for reliable data processing.
- **Tables:** Structured data containers in Delta Lake that store processed data and support querying and analytics with features like schema enforcement and time travel.
- **Notebooks:** Interactive environments where users write and execute code (e.g., Python, Scala) to analyze data, build models, and visualize results.
- **Pipelines:** Automated workflows that orchestrate the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of data across various sources and destinations within the Fabric ecosystem.
- **Apache Spark:** A distributed processing engine that enables scalable data analytics and transformation on large datasets within the Microsoft Fabric platform.
- **Data Lake:** A centralized storage system that stores large volumes of raw, unstructured, and structured data for further processing and analysis.
